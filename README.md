# web_scraping_project
YThis is a web-scraping and data analysis project. I have identified HTML elements on a page, identified their id and class attributes, and used this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. I have also scraped various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

What I have Created

This project consists of two technical products. I submitted the following deliverables:
Deliverable 1: Scraped titles and previewed text from Mars news articles (mars_news file)
Deliverable 2: Scraped and analyzed Mars weather data, which exists in a table (mars_weather file)
